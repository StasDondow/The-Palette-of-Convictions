# The Palette of Convictions
For this project, I conducted a survey among 200+ random respondents and gathered an original dataset.  
Then I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis using pandas.  
Subsequently, I performed several statistical tests in Excel, utilizing tools such as the chi-square test, Student's t-test, various types of correlations, simple linear regression, and A/B testing.
